## Version 104.0.1293.58: August 16

Fixed various bugs.

### Feature updates

- **Support for disabling of inPrivate browsing and Password feature (iOS and Android).**  Before Microsoft Edge 104, Edge for iOS and Android disabled InPrivate browsing and Password (prompts to save passwords for the user) by default when only allow Work or School Accounts is configured.<br><br>
Starting with Microsoft Edge 104, you have more flexibility because InPrivate and Password won't be disabled by default when only allow Work or School Accounts is configured. Instead, you can decide whether to disable InPrivate browsing or Password by configuring the **com.microsoft.intune.mam.managedbrowser.disabledFeatures** key. For more information, see [Disable specific features](/mem/intune/apps/manage-microsoft-edge#disable-specific-features).
